## Description

This project is built with [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework + TypeScript + MongoDB + Swagger.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

- Download and install MongoDB. (To view the database as well, download and install MongoDB Compass). Make sure your MongoDB is running locally.

- Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` if there's no `.env` file already.

- You are done! You can start the application in watch mode with this command `npm run start:dev`. After that, you can view the full swagger documentation of this API at this url `http://localhost:3000/api/docs/`. Thanks.

- You can also run the tests with this command `npm run test`.

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Notes
- I only did some basic tests which can be improved with time and the overall application. Thanks!
